### Setting up Git:

1. **Initialize a Git repository:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2. **Clone a repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

### Basic Git Commands:

3. **Check the status of your repository:**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```

4. **Stage changes for commit:**
    ```bash
    git add <file(s)>
    ```

5. **Commit changes:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```

6. **Push changes to a remote repository:**
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

7. **Pull changes from a remote repository:**
    ```bash
    git pull origin <branch-name>
    ```

### Branching and Merging:

8. **Create a new branch:**
    ```bash
    git branch <branch-name>
    ```

9. **Switch to a branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout <branch-name>
    ```

10. **Merge branches:**
    ```bash
    git merge <branch-name>
    ```

11. **Delete a branch:**
    ```bash
    git branch -d <branch-name>
    ```

### Working with Remotes:

12. **Add a remote repository:**
    ```bash
    git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>
    ```

13. **Remove a remote repository:**
    ```bash
    git remote remove <remote-name>
    ```

14. **Fetch changes from a remote repository:**
    ```bash
    git fetch <remote-name>
    ```

### Handling Conflicts:

15. **Check for conflicts:**
    ```bash
    git diff
    ```

16. **Resolve conflicts and mark as resolved:**
    ```bash
    git add <conflicted-file(s)>
    ```

17. **Continue with the merge after conflicts:**
    ```bash
    git merge --continue
    ```

### Logging and History:

18. **View commit history:**
    ```bash
    git log
    ```

19. **View a specific commit:**
    ```bash
    git show <commit-hash>
    ```

20. **Undo the last commit (careful with this):**
    ```bash
    git reset --hard HEAD^
    ```
